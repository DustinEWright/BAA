# BAA
Budget Analystâ€™s Assistant: A simple parse, table, choose, then interpolate project 

The source for this project has gone private (to bitbucket.org).  This repo will have the exercise descriptions.  Eventually, sample solutions too.

Here is the plan.  We'll see how things go:
1. exercise 1 -- e1 -- create a high level wireframe based on https://codepen.io/wizly/pen/BlKxo/ with four tabs
   1. Home -- gives an overview of using the program
   2. CSV -- Load the CSV into the program
   3. Build madlib -- choose cells from the table and match them to components of the letter
   4. View letter -- view the finished letter.  Suitable for copy & pasting.
2. exercise 2 -- e2 -- fill in the details of the wireframe
3. exercise 3 -- e3 -- bring datatables.net into the application to make the CSV tab work.
4. exercise 4 -- e4 -- start using browserify
5. exercise 5 -- e5 -- TDD of round 1 of the handlers for table cell click and letter blank click
6. exercise 6 -- e6 -- TDD of parsing letter text into clickable blanks (buttons)
7. exercise 7 -- e7 -- TDD of round 2 of the handlers
